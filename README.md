## Contents of the repository

### picam

Picam is a HTML/CSS/JS interface for the Raspberry Pi camera, which is accessible over the local access point. The Local IP address for accessing picam is [http://171.20.11.10/html/picam/](http://171.20.11.10/html/picam/).

### PiViewer

PiViewer is an localhost HTML/CSS/JS interface for streaming Google Cardboard - compatible livestream from the RPi camera. The Local IP address for accessing picam is [http://171.20.11.10/html/PiViewer/](http://171.20.11.10/html/PiViewer/).

### servoPWM

ServoPWM is a folder with files that control the servo. It does so using Python, and specifically its library ... 

## Problem Statement

Currently, there are few consumer solutions on the market that integrate Virtual Reality and Drones.
Being able to use VR for controlling the drone allows for more intuitive control, which has applications in a variety of fields, where full immersion control is an unmet need, such as surveillance, emergency rescue services, reconnaissance in hard-to-reach areas, and entertainment.

## Hardware Used

### 1 . [Raspberry Pi 3 Model B](https://www.raspberrypi.org)

Raspberry Pi was used as a main platform for software-hardware integration. It was the best option for integrating a camera, broadcasting the image over the local network, creating a VR compatibe imagery, and controlling a servo holding the camera on a drone. It can be purchased on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-Pi-RASPBERRYPI3-MODB-1GB-Model-Motherboard/dp/B01CD5VC92/ref=sr_1_3?s=pc&ie=UTF8&qid=1511748097&sr=1-3&keywords=raspberry+pi).

### 2. [Futaba S3003 Servo](https://www.towerhobbies.com/cgi-bin/wti0001p?&I=LXH288)

Futaba S3003 Servo is a nice motor that can be programmed using a breadboard and a Raspberry Pi or Arduino or any other electronics modeling hardware. Full specs in the link above. It can be purchased on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/Futaba-FUTM0031-S3003-Standard-Servo/dp/B0015H2V72/ref=sr_1_1?s=toys-and-games&ie=UTF8&qid=1511748433&sr=1-1&keywords=futaba+s3003).

### 3. [Raspberry PI 5MP Camera Board Module](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/14028)

A nice camera that is meant for use with Raspberry Pi. Full specs in the link above. It can be purchased on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/Raspberry-5MP-Camera-Board-Module/dp/B00E1GGE40).

### 4. [Samsung 32GB 95MB/s (U1) MicroSD EVO Select Memory Card](https://www.samsung.com/us/computing/memory-storage/memory-cards/microsdhc-evo-select-memory-card-w--adapter-32gb--2017-model--mb-me32ga-am/)

32GB memory card compatible for use as Raspberry Pi storage. Full specs in the link above. It can be purchased on Amazon [here](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B01DOB6Y5Q/ref=sspa_dk_detail_6?psc=1).

## Software Used

### 1. [Apache2 Server](http://httpd.apache.org)

Apache2 was installed on the Raspberry Pi to run a local HTTP server to broadcast what the camera is currently seeing over the local network.

### 2. [Arduino](https://www.arduino.cc)

Arduino software was used for calibrating the the servo, as well as programming it to respond to the gyroscopic inputs. Downloadable for desktop [here](https://www.arduino.cc/en/Main/Software), as an online editor (Arduino create) [here](https://create.arduino.cc).
